Hand-in Report for RabbitMQ Experiments**

#### **1. Technical Problems Encountered**

While working through the Python scripts, the `pika` library worked smoothly, 
but I had to ensure that my version of `pika` was up to date. 
Some deprecated methods and changes in the API caused confusion, and upgrading `pika` resolved these issues. 
Other than that I hardly had any problems during this assignment.
