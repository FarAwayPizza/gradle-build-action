### Assignment 2 text

All in all I followed the assignment step by step.
The main problems I had in this assignment where related to my lack of knowledge when it came to Java and Gradle.

### Unresolved technical issues

I have errors in the build.gradle.kts file and in the settings.gradle.kts file that I still have not been able to resolve. I have reloaded the Gradle project and ensured that the proper dependencies and plugins were included. But IntelliJ continue to flag unresolved references in the build file.
Everything still runs as it should, but it might hinder future progress.
